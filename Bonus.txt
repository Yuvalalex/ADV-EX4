1. COLORS
   -------
   - All objects have colors
   - Bombs flash when about to explode
   - Switches change color when toggled
   - Can turn colors off in menu (option 3)

2. SMART ENEMIES & SWORD
   --------------
   - Enemies chase the closest player (By ABS)
   - They find path around walls
   - If you have sword they die, otherwise you lose life
   - They move every 2 game cycles ( not too fast ) by EntityManager  
    - Defeat: By Bomb or sword 


3. RANDOM TELEPORTS
   -----------------
   - Teleports send you to random other teleport
   - Not just fixed pairs
